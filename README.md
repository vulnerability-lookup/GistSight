# GistSight

A client for gathering vulnerability-related information from GitHub Gists.
The collected data is then sent to the
[Vulnerability-Lookup](https://github.com/vulnerability-lookup/vulnerability-lookup) API as sightings.


## Installation

[pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) is an easy way to install and run Python applications in isolated environments.
It's easy to [install](https://github.com/pypa/pipx?tab=readme-ov-file#on-linux).

```bash
$ pipx install GistSight
$ export GISTSIGHT_CONFIG=~/.gistsight/conf.py
```


### With Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vulnerability-lookup/GistSight
cd GistSight

# Make sure conf.py exists in the project root before running
docker compose up --build
```

> [!NOTE]
> The docker-compose.yml expects a conf.py file in the root directory.
> You can create it manually or copy the provided example:
> 
> ```bash
> $ cp gistsight/conf_sample.py conf.py
> ```
